# The outside face of a subtree boundary: the level-`l` cells that are NOT
# descendants of `c` but have a neighbour that is.
#
# One public type, one private ENGINE per system, exactly as the rim and
# interior walks are built (`subtree_iterators.jl`). The engine is chosen once,
# at construction, by `halo_engine` — private multiple dispatch, so an engine's
# whole protocol is monomorphic and a system adds a fast path by adding one
# method, not by setting a flag anyone can read.
#
# Every engine here is EXACT. A specialization may enumerate a conservative
# candidate band, but it must run the adjacency test on every candidate before
# yielding it: approximation never reaches this file's public surface.

"""
    SubtreeHaloIterator(sys, c, l; connectivity = Vertex())

The halo of `c`'s subtree at level `l`, lazily: every level-`l` cell that is
**not** a descendant of `c` but has a neighbour that is, in ascending canonical
order, each cell exactly once.

`collect` of this is [`subtree_halo`](@ref), element for element. `l == level(c)`
is `c`'s own one-ring, sorted. `l < level(c)` and `l > max_level(sys)` throw an
`ArgumentError`.

Construction never materialises the halo: the iterator holds `O(depth)` walk
state and bounded native neighbour containers, and nothing sized by the answer.
Taking the first few cells of a deep halo therefore costs what those cells cost,
not what the whole ring would.

[`Base.IteratorSize`](@ref) is `SizeUnknown()` wherever no count is proved —
face seams, poles and pentagons break perimeter formulas — and `HasLength()`
only where an engine derives the count in closed form. There is no `length` that
would silently cost a traversal.

See also [`EdgeCellIterator`](@ref) for the inside face of the same boundary.
